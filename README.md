# HiksLoader
Loads stuff for Discord.

Currently loads:
• Zerthox ClearVision
• Zerebos RadialStatus

(PS. Don't have those guys permission. Sorry, guys! You still own all the permissions and rights. When you want it removed, you got it done.)

Adds few quick variables to change stuff.

List of variables (goes into Custom CSS :root{}):

* --z-background: url(#); Allows changing the background of Zerthox without copy-pasting his whole theme code into Custom CSS.
* --i/b-f: font; Allows switching out italic or bold font. Just use either i-f or b-f, not i/b-f.
* --i/b-gf: family; In here you can use cursive, fantasy, etc. Same applies as above. ^
* --i/b-pad: Padding.
* --i/b-size: Size.

Please do not use bold for now, unless you want giant names and stuff. Not dealing with it at the moment, as to trying to fix import issues.

A few tiny animations:
* Idle animation -- Pulses slowly between dark orange-red and bright yellow.
* (edited) animation -- Everytime someone fucks up, you'll be sure to see. In fact, you could start a rave with this shit (PS. It blinks).

###
Known bugs:

#1. Fonts do not load.
Currently trying to figure that out. Just likes being an ass.

#2. Zerebos RadialStatus does not load.
Same as above. Something is causing a failure in importing, causing all fonts and following imports to fail.

#3.  Bold changes names, statuses and other stuff.
Like said, not dealing with that issue, as I'm trying to figure out the import fail.

#4.  Animations in giant servers.
It isn't neccesarily a bug, but don't use this in giant servers, as to your cpu will fry. The whole reason there is no infinite animations
in Discord, is because of that. Imagine trying to game and study at the same time, while cutting your nails or shit, without failing any. That's pretty much it.
Don't ask me why I thought of cutting nails. Nothing better popped in this empty head of mine.
Just don't, ok?

#5. Something more??
I don't freaking know. o.o
