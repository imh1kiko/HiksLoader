# HiksLoader
Loads stuff for Discord.

Currently loads:
* Zerthox ClearVision
* Zerebos RadialStatus
* Some custom styles

(PS. Don't have those guys permission. Sorry, guys! You still own all the permissions and rights. When you want it removed, you got it done.)

# Variables!
To be honest, I've created and tested so many of them, I'm prolly forgetting some or adding wrong ones.
Do keep in mind, these go into "Custom CSS" section in BetterDiscord. Also, between :root {}

> --main-color: rgba(x,x,x,x);
This color paints most of your discord. This is core part of ClearVision, and I take no credit for it!
> --hover-color: rgba();
This is ClearVision's hover!
> --voiceColor: rgba();
Changes to color of voice indicator when speaking.




# Known bugs:

1. Lag in giant servers.
A: This isn't meant to be used in giant servers (which is obvious, due to animations). It's just a theme me and SO use in our server. If you want to, just fork it and JsDelivr it yourself.
