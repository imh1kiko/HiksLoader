Loads stuff for Discord.

Currently loads:
• Zerthox ClearVision
• Zerebos RadialStatus
• Some custom styles

(PS. Don't have those guys permission. Sorry, guys! You still own all the permissions and rights. When you want it removed, you got it done.)

Adds few quick variables to change stuff.

List of variables (goes into Custom CSS :root{}):

* --z-background: url(#); Allows changing the background of Zerthox without copy-pasting his whole theme code into Custom CSS.
* --z-effects: attrs; Allows adding filters to background.
* --z-shadow: attrs; Allows vignetting the background. Use 'inset Xpx Ypx Spx Apx rgba(color)'. Check the documentation for box-shadow to learn more.
* --i/b-f: font; Allows switching out italic or bold font. Just use either i-f or b-f, not i/b-f.
* --i/b-gf: family; In here you can use cursive, fantasy, etc. Same applies as above. ^
* --i/b-pad: Padding.
* --i/b-size: Size.

Please do not use bold for now, unless you want giant names and stuff. Not dealing with it at the moment, as to trying to fix import issues.

A few tiny animations:
* Idle animation -- Pulses slowly between dark orange-red and bright yellow.
* (edited) animation -- Everytime someone fucks up, you'll be sure to see. In fact, you could start a rave with this shit (PS. It blinks).
* Busy animation -- transitions (ping-pong) between offline and busy (red). So you REALLY know you ain't there.
* Spoiler text -- Also known as **bold**. It was pretty useless, so I repurposed it.

1. Lag in giant servers.
A: This isn't meant to be used in giant servers. It's a theme me and a friend use.
